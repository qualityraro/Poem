'Demons’ - Tomás Jose González

In our weakest form, defences low,
wisps crawl, walls down, grief sows.
a demon, sightless, stands tall,
it whispers lonely, sad songs.

Oh, how near, a silhouette as such,
I felt the clutch of death itself, 
the depth of anguish and despair,
roams ceaselessly without a care.

These are the colors of the Rainbow.
