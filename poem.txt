'Demon’ - Tomás Jose González

In our weakest form, defences low,
wisps crawl, walls down, grief sows.
a demon, sightless, stands tall,
it whispers lonely, sad songs.

Oh, how near, a silhouette as such,
I felt the clutch of death itself, 
the depth of anguish and despair,
roams ceaselessly without a care.

Out of sight, they roam, they plight,
our birthmark is a bullseye mark.
Starkest sky, the panther prowls,
I lie wake still, behind it growls.

It’s voice repeats, my name I hear,
what aim it has? It claws, it tears,
that same night, the beast took strife,
stricken fell, those lost in life.

No longer are we — who we were, 
stolen fragments of our stronger selves,
It’s thirst quenched, -------
